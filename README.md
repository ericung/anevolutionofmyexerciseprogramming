# Introduction
This is about the history of my exercise routines and my variations. It should provide a template for you to use if you need an idea to get started on.

# Cardio Focused
## The Basic Template for Running
Template for Running\
Day 1: Slow jog, Light calisthenics, Tempo Run\
Day 2: Easy Run\
Day 3: Slow jog, Light calisthenics, Sprint and/or Fartleks\
Day 4: Easy Run\
Day 5: Long Run\

You can switch days 1, 3, and 5 or do more types of day 1's, 2's, or 3's on one week if needed depending if you looking to work on pace, speed, or volume.

Tempo runs are typically around 5 kilometers to 10 kilometers and the purpose is to simulate a slightly slower race pace. It trains the body to handle lactic acid and works the fast and slow twitch muscles.

Easy runs are supposed to increase your mileage if you are in need of adding more volume and it is a form of active recovery if done properly.

Sprint/fartleks/High Intensity Training - The aim of this form of exercise is to also increase heart capacity but also work on a the fast twitch muscle.

Long runs are aimed to work on increasing mileage, heart capacity, and slow twitch muscles. It is meant to be at a slower pace than the tempo run and the sprint type of workouts.

Volume is increased in the beginning and slowly reduced with an increase in intensity.

# Lifting
## The Bro Split
Template for bro splits\
Day 1: Leg Day\
Day 2: Chest Day\
Day 3: Deadlift and Back Day\
Day 4: Shoulder Day\
Day 5: Arm Day\

The purpose of this template is to learn as many types of exercises as you possibly can and, more importantly, enjoy going to the gym.

You can start with any days you want but you'd want to start with either day 1, 2, or 3 because they are heavier lifts.

The problem with this template is that going to exhaustion every day can get tiring because it burns the CNS, tears your muscles up too much on one end of the spectrum and on the other end of the spectrum it doesn't work out certain major muscles enough like the legs.

One advice here is that deadlifting once a week is enough because if you lift heavy enough, it should burn your CNS.

The most important advice if you start with this routine is to learn how to eat enough protein, carbs, and fat in a way that allows you to ingest it all without throwing up. Discovering what kind of macronutrient your body needs is important in the long run. Some people need more protein, others need more carbs, and others need fat. Others need amix of the three.

## Starting Strength and the 5x5
Template for starting strength and 5x5\
**Week 1**\
Day 1: Squat, Bench, Deadlift\
Day 2: Squat, Press, Clean\
Day 3: Squat, Bench, Deadlift or Accessory\
**Week 2**\
Day 1: Squat, Press, Deadlift\
Day 2: Squat, Bench, Clean\
Day 3: Squat, Press, Clean or Accessory\

This program is more intense than it seems because you will increase strength at a very fast pace if you do it correctly.

For squats, benches, and cleans, aim for 3x5 or 5x5 which an increase of 5 pounds every time you go to the gym.

Once you get stuck, you go down from 5x5 or 3x5 to 3x3 then 1x5 then 1x3 then 1x1(maxing out).

Generally for deadlifts, a set of 1x5 and for cleans, specifically power cleans, 3x3 is aimed.

The aim of this is to increase strength and so eating and resting is emphasized. If you started with the bro split or any routine in the past, it should help you build a basis of the food and rest you need to handle this program.

In addition, the repetitiveness of these exercises is to practice form so that you reduce injury in heavy loads.

For accessory, it's my preference to use barbell rows.

After awhile, I wanted to try other physical activity so I started deviating from powerlifting programs.

# My Variation after starting strength
Template Splitting up upper and lower, this is cited somewhere in one of Mark Rippetoe's book\
Day 1: Bench or Press(3x5)\
Day 2: Squat(3x5), Deadlift(1x5)\
Day 3: Press or Bench(3x5)\
Day 4: Squat(3x5), Barbell Row(3x5)\
Day 5: Bench or Press(3x5)\
Day 6: Squat(3x5), Clean(3x3)\

The aim of this variation for me is to start adding some accessories that I like and, also, do other activities like cycling, climbing, running, etc.

You can skip any day and still be able to make progress if you still want to. 

You can also only work out two to four days a week should you so choose or if time doesn't allow it.
